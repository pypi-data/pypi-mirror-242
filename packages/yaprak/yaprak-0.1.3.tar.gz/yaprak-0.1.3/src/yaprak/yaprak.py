            This method runs for all instances (defined as an ID, an input file,
            and an output file). If any of the parameters don't exist, the
            operation stops.

            and executed. The process_spec can include basic parameters such as 
            numbers, booleans, and strings, which the json file supports.

            The process will be skipped if the process_spec does not have the
            apply property. This way, processes can be disabled quickly by just
            removing the apply property.
