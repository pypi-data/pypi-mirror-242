# EasyDeL

EasyDeL (Easy Deep Learning) is an open-source library designed to accelerate and optimize the training process of
machine learning models. This library is primarily focused on Jax/Flax and plans to offer easy and fine solutions to
train Flax/Jax Models on the `TPU/GPU` both for Serving and Training (EasyDel will support mojo and be rewriten for mojo
too)

you can also tell me the model you want in Flax/Jax version and ill try my best to build it ;)

### EasyDel Mojo

EasyDel Mojo differs from EasyDel in Python in significant ways. In Python, you can leverage a vast array of packages to
create a mid or high-level API in no time. However, when working with Mojo, it's a different story. Here, you have to
build some of the features that other Python libraries provide, such as Jax for arrays and computations. But why not
import numpy, Jax, and other similar packages to Mojo and use them?

There are several reasons why building packages in Mojo is more efficient than importing them from Python. Firstly, when
you import packages from Python, you incur the overhead of translating and processing the Python code into Mojo code,
which takes time. Secondly, the Python code may not be optimized for the Mojo runtime environment, leading to slower
performance. Lastly, building packages directly in Mojo allows you to design and optimize them explicitly for the Mojo
runtime environment, resulting in faster and more efficient code. With Mojo's built-in array capabilities that are
35000x faster than Python, it's time to take your coding to the next level.

#### Note this Library needs golang to run (for some tracking stuff on TPU/GPU/CPU)

#### Ubuntu GO installation

```shell
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install golang -y 
```

#### Manjaro/Arch GO installation

```shell
sudo pacman -Syyuu go
```

_you can install other version too but easydel required at least version of 0.4.10_

```shell
!pip install jax[tpu] -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/libtpu_releases.html -q
```

on GPUs be like

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
# CUDA 12 installation
# Note: wheels only available on linux.
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
# CUDA 11 installation
# Note: wheels only available on linux.
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda11_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

## Tutorials

_Tutorials on how to use and train or serve your models with EasyDel is available at examples dir_

1. [_Serving_](https://github.com/erfanzar/EasyDeL/tree/main/examples/serving)

2. [_Train_](https://github.com/erfanzar/EasyDeL/tree/main/examples/training/causal-lm)

3. [_Use Llama 2 Models_](https://github.com/erfanzar/EasyDeL/blob/main/LLAMA.md)

## Serving

you can read docs or examples to see how `JAXServer` works but let me show you how you can simply host and serve a
LLama2
chat model (70B model is supported too)

```shell
python -m examples.serving.causal-lm.llama-2-chat \
  --repo_id='meta-llama/Llama.md-2-7b-chat-hf' --max_length=4096 \
  --max_new_tokens=2048 --max_stream_tokens=32 --temperature=0.6 \
  --top_p=0.95 --top_k=50 \
  --dtype='fp16' --use_prefix_tokenizer

```

you can use all of the llama models not just 'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf'

'fp16' Or 'fp32' , 'bf16' are supported dtype

make sure to use --use_prefix_tokenizer

and you will get links or api to use model from gradio app chat/instruct or FastAPI apis

## RLHF(Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback)

`RLHF` or Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback is Available At the moment, but it's still
under heavy development , because i don't have enough experience with Reinforcement Learning at the moment so its still
in beta version but it's works and ill soon release a Tutorial For that

## FineTuning

with using EasyDel FineTuning LLM (CausalLanguageModels) are easy as much as possible with using Jax and Flax
and having the benefit of TPUs for the best speed here's a simple code to use in order to finetune your
own *_MPT / LLama / Falcon / OPT / GPT-J / GPT-Neox / Palm / T5_*
or any other models supported by EasyDel

#### Step One

Days Has Been Passed and now using easydel in Jax is way more similar to HF/PyTorch Style
now it's time to finetune our model

```python
import jax.numpy
from EasyDel import TrainArguments, CausalLMTrainer, AutoEasyDelModelForCausalLM, FlaxLlamaForCausalLM
from datasets import load_dataset
import flax
from jax import numpy as jnp

llama, params = AutoEasyDelModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("", )
# Llama 2 Max Sequence Length is 4096

max_length = 4096

configs_to_init_model_class = {
    'config': llama.config,
    'dtype': jnp.bfloat16,
    'param_dtype': jnp.bfloat16,
    'input_shape': (1, 1)
}

train_args = TrainArguments(
    model_class=FlaxLlamaForCausalLM,
    model_name='my_first_model_to_train_using_easydel',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    learning_rate_end=1e-6,
    optimizer='adamw',  # 'adamw', 'lion', 'adafactor' are supported
    scheduler='linear',  # 'linear','cosine', 'none' ,'warm_up_cosine' and 'warm_up_linear'  are supported
    weight_decay=0.01,
    total_batch_size=64,
    max_steps=None,  # None to let trainer Decide
    do_train=True,
    do_eval=False,  # it's optional but supported 
    backend='tpu',  # default backed is set to cpu, so you must define you want to use tpu cpu or gpu
    max_length=max_length,  # Note that you have to change this in the model config too
    gradient_checkpointing='nothing_saveable',
    sharding_array=(1, -1, 1),  # the way to shard model across gpu,cpu or TPUs using sharding array (1, -1, 1)
    # everything training will be in fully FSDP automatic and share data between devices
    use_pjit_attention_force=False,
    remove_ckpt_after_load=True,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=8,
    loss_remat='',
    dtype=jnp.bfloat16
)
dataset = load_dataset('TRAIN_DATASET')
dataset_train = dataset['train']
dataset_eval = dataset['eval']

trainer = CausalLMTrainer(
    train_args,
    dataset_train,
    ckpt_path=None
)

output = trainer.train(flax.core.FrozenDict({'params': params}))
print(f'Hey ! , here\'s where your model saved {output.last_save_file_name}')


```

you can then convert it to pytorch for better use I don't recommend jax/flax for hosting models since
pytorch is better option for gpus

## Usage

To use EasyDeL in your project, you will need to import the library in your Python script and use its various functions
and classes. Here is an example of how to import EasyDeL and use its Model class:

```python
from EasyDel.modules import FlaxLlamaForCausalLM, LlamaConfig
from EasyDel.serve import JAXServer
from EasyDel.transform import llama_from_pretrained
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

import jax

model_id = 'meta-llama/Llama.md-2-7b-chat-hf'

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True)

params, config = llama_from_pretrained(model_id, jax.devices('cpu')[0])
model = FlaxLlamaForCausalLM(
    config,
    dtype='float16',
    param_dtype='float16',
    _do_init=False,
)
server = JAXServer.load_from_params(
    model=model,
    config_model=config,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    params=model.params,
    add_params_field=True
)

response_printed = 0
for response, tokens_used in server.process(
        'String To The Model', stream=True
):
    print(response[response_printed:], end='')
    response_printed = len(response)
```
