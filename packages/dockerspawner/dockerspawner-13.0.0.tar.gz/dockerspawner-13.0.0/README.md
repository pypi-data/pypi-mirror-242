The **dockerspawner** (also known as JupyterHub Docker Spawner), enables
[JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) to spawn single user
notebook servers in [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).

There are three basic types of spawners available for dockerspawner:

- DockerSpawner: takes an authenticated user and spawns a notebook server
  in a Docker container for the user.
- SwarmSpawner: launches single user notebook servers as Docker Swarm mode
  services.
- SystemUserSpawner: spawns single user notebook servers
  that correspond to system users.

See the [DockerSpawner documentation](https://jupyterhub-dockerspawner.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
for more information about features and usage.
