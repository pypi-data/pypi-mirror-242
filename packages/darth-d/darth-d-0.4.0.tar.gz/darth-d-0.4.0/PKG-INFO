A simple to use image generator based on [OpenAIs DALL-E 2/3](https://openai.com/dall-e-2).
It comes as [napari](https://napari.org/) plugin and has a Python interface. 
You need an [OpenAI API KEY](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) to use it.

Using some of the functions on scientific images could be seen as scientific misconduct. Handle these functions with care.

## Usage

### From Python

You can generate images from text prompts in Python like this ([see this notebool](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/darth-d/blob/main/demo/demo_darth-d.ipynb)).

```
from darth_d import create
```

```
image = create("an image of a cat")

image
```

You can also vary images ([see this notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/darth-d/blob/main/demo/demo_vary.ipynb)):
```
from darth_d import vary

output_image = vary(input_image)
```

Replacing regions in images is also possible. Note: Using this function on scientific images could be seen as scientific misconduct. Handle this function with care.

### In Napari

To generate images in Napari, click the `Tools > Generate > Image` menu. You can for example enter the prompt
"a professional comic with white background showing a cat having an idea. the idea is visualized using a light bulb.

## Installation

```
pip install darth-d
```

If you want to use it from napari, please also install napari and the [tools menu](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-tools-menu):

```
mamba install napari pyqt napari-tools-menu -c conda-forge
```
