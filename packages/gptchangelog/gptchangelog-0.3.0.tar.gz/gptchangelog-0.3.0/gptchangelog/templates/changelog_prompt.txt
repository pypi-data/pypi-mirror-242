Changelog Generation for Software Project (Version: $next_version)

Date: $current_date

Commit Messages:
```
$commit_messages
```

Objective: Create a structured, clear, and concise changelog in markdown format, reflecting the changes made in the latest software version.

Instructions:

    Format the Changelog Header:
        Use markdown's '##' syntax to format the version header.
        Follow the pattern: ## [$next_version] - $current_date

    Process Commit Messages:
        Categorize these messages under relevant headers like 'Added', 'Fixed', 'Changed', etc.
        Ensure each commit message is converted into a bullet point under the appropriate header.

    Exclude Empty Sections:
        If there are no commit messages for a particular category (like 'Removed'), do not include that section in the changelog.

Changelog Template:

    ## [$next_version] - $current_date
    ### Added
    - (List out added features or enhancements)
    ### Fixed
    - (List out bug fixes)
    ### Changed
    - (List out updates to existing features)
    ... (Include other relevant sections like 'Removed', 'Deprecated', etc., if applicable)

Ensure that the changelog is succinct, accurately reflects the changes, and adheres to markdown syntax. Avoid inclusion of irrelevant or redundant information.
