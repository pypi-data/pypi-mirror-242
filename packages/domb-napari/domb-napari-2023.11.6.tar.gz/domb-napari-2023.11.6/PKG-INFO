## DoMB Tools for napari

Implementation of the [DoMB Tools](https://domb.bio/) package as plugin for [napari](https://napari.org/).

A Napari plugin offers widgets to analyze fluorescence-labeled proteins redistribution in widefield epifluorescence time-lapse acquisitions. Useful for studying calcium-dependent translocation of neuronal calcium sensors, synaptic receptors traffic during long-term plasticity induction, membrane protein tracking, etc.

_Currently, the plugin lacks test coverage!_

## Widgets
### Image Preprocessing
Provides functions for preprocessing multi-channel fluorescence acquisitions:
- If the input image has 4 dimensions (time, channel, x-axis, y-axis), channels will be split into individual 3 dimensions images (time, x-axis, y-axis) with the `_ch%index%` suffix.
- If the `gaussian blur` option is selected, the image will be blurred with a Gaussian filter using sigma=`gaussian sigma`.
- If the `photobleaching correction` option is selected, the image will undergo correction with exponential (method `exp`) or bi-exponential (method `bi_exp`) fitting.

### Red-Green Series
Primary method for detecting fluorescent-labeled targets redistribution in time. Returns a series of differential images representing the intensity difference between the current frame and the previous one as new image with the `_red-green` siffix.

Parameters:
- `left frames` - number of previous frames for pixel-wise averaging.
- `space frames` - number of frames between the last left and first right frames.
- `right frames` - number of subsequent frames for pixel-wise averaging.
- `save mask series` - if selected, a series of labels will be created for each frame of the differential image with the threshold `insertion threshold`.

### Up Mask
Generates labels for insertion sites (regions with increasing intensity) based on `-red-green` images. Returns labels layer with `_up-labels` siffix.

Parameters:
- `detection img index` - index of the frame from `-red-green` image used for insertion sites detection.
- `insertion threshold` - threshold value for insertion site detection, intensity on selected `_red-green` frame normalized in -1 - 0 range.
- `save mask` - if selected, a total up mask (containing all ROIs) will be created with the `_up-mask` suffix.

### Individual Labels Profiles
Builds a plot with mean intensity profiles for each ROI in `labels` using absolute intensity (if `raw intensity` is selected) or relative intensities (ΔF/F0).

The `time scale` sets the number of seconds between frames for x-axis scaling.

The baseline intensity for ΔF/F0 profiles is estimated as the mean intensity of the initial profile points (`ΔF win`).

Filters ROIs by minimum (`min amplitude`) and maximum (`max amplitude`) intensity amplitudes.

_Note: Intensity filtering is most relevant for ΔF/F0 profiles._

### Labels Profile
Builds a plot with the averaged intensity of all ROIs in `labels`. Can take two images (`img 0` and `img 1`) as input if `two profiles` are selected.

The `time scale` and `ΔF win` are the same as in the __Individual Labels Profiles__.

The `stat method` provides methods for calculating intensity errors:
- `se` - standard error of mean.
- `iqr` - interquartile range.
- `ci` - 95% confidence interval for t-distribution.
