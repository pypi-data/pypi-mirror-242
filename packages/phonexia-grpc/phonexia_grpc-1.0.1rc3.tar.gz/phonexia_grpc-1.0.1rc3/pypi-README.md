# Phonexia microservice communication via grpc library

This library contains defined interfaces for all microservices developed by [Phonexia](phonexia.com).

To use this library you will first need a running instance of any Phonexia microservice. If you don't yet have any running instance, don't hesitate to [contact our sales department](mailto:info@phonexia.com).
