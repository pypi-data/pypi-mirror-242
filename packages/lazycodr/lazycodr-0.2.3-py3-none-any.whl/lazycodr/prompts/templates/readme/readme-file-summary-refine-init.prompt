Given a file from a software repository, extract the following meaningful information that will be essential for building a comprehensive README.md:

File Name: Identify the name of the file.
Purpose: Summarize the primary purpose or functionality of the file.
Functions/Methods: List major functions or methods present in the file, along with a brief description of what each does.
Dependencies: Identify any external libraries or dependencies that this file relies on.
Usage Examples: If possible, extract any usage examples or code snippets that demonstrate how functions/methods in the file are used.
Notes: Highlight any special remarks, TODOs, or important comments that give context about the file's usage, limitations, or future improvements.
Extract this information in a structured format so that it can be efficiently used to build a README.md file later.

Here is the file:
<file>
{text}
</file>
