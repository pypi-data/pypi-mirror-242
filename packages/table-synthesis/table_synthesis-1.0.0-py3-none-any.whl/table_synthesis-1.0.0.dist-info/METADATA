# Table Synthesis Library

## Introduction
This is the Table Image Synthesis tool that can generate a number of template table images given a template, with a goal of providing similar images to fine-tune the table recognition model. This is done by keeping the table structure and changing the text inside it.


## Usage

First, depending on the browser you use, get the corresponding driver executable with the browser ([chromedriver.exe](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) for Chrome or [geckodriver.exe](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) for Firefox) from the Internet. Then put the driver file in the same directory as your main file.

The full model usage can be found here:

```
from table_synthesis import SynthesizeTable

syn = SynthesizeTable(input_path='test',
                        out_path='test_out')

syn(num_synth=1)
```
Here, the `input_path` is the path to the folder with the `gt.txt` file (which is a label file exported from PPOCRLabel program), and optionally the extra html files in the `html/` folder if using TableGeneration tool.

The `out_path` should be the folder containing the output (recommended empty).

Then initilalize the Synthesis class and run it to generate `num_synth` images from each label image.
