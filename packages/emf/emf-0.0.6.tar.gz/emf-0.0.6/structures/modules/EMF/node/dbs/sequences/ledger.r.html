	example:
		1000 steps and then an aggregate
		
		could be votes on whether or not to increase
		step variables
		
		
	steps:
		#
		#	escrow aggregate limit: {10000}
		#		after {10000} aggregates escrow
		#		is returned to sender.
		#
		#	1000000000000000000000000
		#	1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
		#
		steps: [{
			step: 1,
			contract: "mint",
			public: {public},
			amount: 1000000000000000000000000000
		},{
			step: 2,
			unsigned_message: {
				contract: "escrow",
				
				#
				#	for aggregate 1 implies that this petition is to
				#	add an escrow before the aggregate 1 (balance sheet)

				#
				for_aggregate: 1,
				
				#
				#	the number of the escrow within the aggregate

					#	The fraction of currency that the validator possesses.
					#	The fraction sum need to be >= 1/2.
					#	
					#		(obviously there are other voting mechanisms possible)

	aggregates:
		aggregates: [{
			aggregate: 1,
			accounts: [{
