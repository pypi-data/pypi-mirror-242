# robotframework-humanitec

Demo library for Humanitec API. [Keyword Documentation](https://robotframework-humanitec-noordsestern-f672fb1c9b527e491cb115577.gitlab.io/)

## State: Alpha

There are not many keywords implemented, yet, as this is a demo right now. I am undecided whether to use auto generated swagger client or rely entirely on handmade REST calls based on requests module.

# Installation

```
pip install robotframework-humanitec
```

# Usage

See [`demo.robot`](tests/demo.robot). The demo uses Humanitec library as well as [score-humanitec](https://docs.score.dev/docs/get-started/score-humanitec-hello-world/) commandline tool.

## Environment Variables

You will need:

- environment variable `HUMANITEC_TOKEN` with value of a valid API token from your Humanitec organisation
- environment variable `HUMANITEC_ORG_ID` with value of id from your Humanitec organisation

# Support

Openapi specifications and generated clients are not perfect. Generators contain bugs, specifications are not deterministic. Here you may find support:
