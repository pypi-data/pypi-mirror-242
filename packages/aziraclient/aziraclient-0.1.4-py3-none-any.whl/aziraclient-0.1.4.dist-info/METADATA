# AziraClient

AziraClient is a compreshensive libraru built on top of [Azira](https://github.com/manny-uncharted/Azira) a service grants users the ability to subscribe and receive crypto tokens data in near real-time. A possible use case for this is when you need to build bots that sends you real-time updates or applications that continuously needs real-time updates about a particular crypto token.

## Features

    ``pip install aziraclient``

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python

from aziraclient.auth.auth_client import AuthClient
from aziraclient.subscription.subscription import SubscribeToToken

# User authentication
"""
base_url: url where your server application is running.
"""
auth_client = AuthClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000")
auth_client.register_user("username", "password")
auth_client.login_user("username", "password")

# WebSocket subscription
"""
username: name of what you registered with
jwt_token: would be returned upon successful login.
action: "subscribe" or "unsubscribe"
token_name: name of token to subscribe to.
url: ipaddress / url address of the server

"""
tester = SubscribeToToken("username", "jwt_token", "action", "token_name", "localhost:8000")
tester.test_connection()

#### Notes

Here are things I need to do to improve this. At the moment this package only works with this project. [Azira](https://github.com/manny-uncharted/Azira)

* If you're interested in testing things out you can check the main project and run it alongside
* Make sure the library works with every stock token on the stock market.
