# About the package

This is a package dedicated to simulation of stochastic processes. In it you will find some simulations of trajectories of various stochastic processes:

- Simple Random Walk,
- Pearson Random Walk,
- Poisson Process,
- Brownian Motion,
- Brownian Bridge,
- Brownian Motion with drift and volatility coefficient, and
- Geometric Brownian Motion
