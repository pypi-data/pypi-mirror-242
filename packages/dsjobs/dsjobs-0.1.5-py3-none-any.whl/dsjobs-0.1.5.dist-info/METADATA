`dsjobs` is a library that simplifies the process of submitting, running, and monitoring [TAPIS v2 / AgavePy](https://agavepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) jobs on [DesignSafe](https://designsafe-ci.org) via [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.designsafe-ci.org).

## Features

* Simplified TAPIS v2 Calls: No need to fiddle with complex API requests. `dsjobs` abstracts away the complexities.

* Seamless Integration with DesignSafe Jupyter Notebooks: Launch DesignSafe applications directly from the Jupyter environment.

## Installation

Install `dsjobs` via pip

```shell
pip3 install dsjobs
```

To install the current development version of the library use:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/DesignSafe-CI/dsjobs.git --quiet
```

## Example usage:

* [Jupyter Notebook Templates](example-notebooks/template-mpm-run.ipynb) using DSJobs.

* View [DSJobs API doc](https://designsafe-ci.github.io/dsjobs/dsjobs/index.html)

On [DesignSafe Jupyter](https://jupyter.designsafe-ci.org/):

Install the latest version of `dsjobs` and restart the kernel (Kernel >> Restart Kernel):

```python
# Remove any previous installations
!pip uninstall dsjobs -y
# Install 
!pip install dsjobs --quiet
```

* Import `dsjobs` library
```python
import dsjobs as ds
```
