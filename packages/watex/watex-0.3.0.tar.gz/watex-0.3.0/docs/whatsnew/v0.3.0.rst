v0.3.0 (November 22, 2023)
--------------------------

These are substantial changes in ``v0.2.7`` API that lead to new features and fugs fixed. 
 
- |API change| Datasets ``h.h5`` and ``n.npz`` for Hongliu hydrogeological logging and Nansha land subsidence data are removed from  
  the software installation. User can fetch the data as usual and should be downloaded remotely. This will considerably reduce the 
  size of the :mod:`watex.datasets` package. 

- |API change| ``watex.methods.em.Processing`` and ``watex.methods.em.ZC`` do no longer exist. 
  They have been changed to :class:`watex.methods.em.EMAP` and 
  :class:`watex.methods.em.MT` respectively.

- |API change| ``watex.utils.funcutils.fit_by_ll`` is deprecated and replaced by :func:`watex.utils.funcutils.fit_ll`. 

- |Fix| Bug in removing the static shift in :term:`AMT` data. Henceforth the correction factor method deprecated method ``watex.methods.em.ZC.get_ss_correction_factors``
  replaced by :meth:`watex.methods.em.MT.get_ss_correction_factors` is applied for each station differently rather than using 
  the factor to correct all stations. There are also a  choice for user to input the correction factors ``ss_fx`` and ``ss_fy`` manually into a list. 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.plotutils.plot_tensors` plots resistivity and phase tensors or the real and imaginary impedance.

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.torres_verdin_filter` calculates the adaptive moving average of a given data array from 
  Torres and Verdin codes.

- |Feature| :func:`watex.methods.em.filter_noises` remove noise from component ``xx``, ``yy``, ``xy`` or ``yx``. 

- |Feature| :meth:`watex.methods.em.MT.remove_noises` removes artifacts in the data and smooth it. 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.methods.em.drop_frequencies` drop bad frequencies or frequencies with no consistent data in the EDI files. 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.plotutils.plot_sounding` plot the vertical electrical resistivity data. 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.baseutils.download_file2` is the new consistent function to download file remotely rather than using 
  :func:`watex.utils.baseutils.get_remote_data`. Both expect ``requests`` library to be installed. 

- |Enhancement| :func:`watex.utils.plot_profiling` accepts `ax` as a paramater. 

- |Enhancement| :func:`watex.view.TPlot.plot_rhophi` changes the style of plot in preceeding versions. It accepts parameter `kind` for plotting multiple stations differently.  

- |Enhancement| Fix overlapping xlabels in the :func:`watex.utils.exmath.plotOhmicArea`.
