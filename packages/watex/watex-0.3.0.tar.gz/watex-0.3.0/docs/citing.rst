If the software is used in any scientific publication, we appreciate citing the paper below. 
Here is a ready-made BibTeX entry:

Moreover, :code:`watex` are used in real-world case study papers. For instance, it was used for  the :term:`flow` rate prediction 
in :term:`Bagoue region` applying the support vector-machines (SVMs) and provides complete details explanations about the :term:`DC-resistivity` 
parameter definitions (:func:`watex.datasets.load_bagoue`). Here is a ready-made BibTeX entry of the published papers:

Furthermore, :code:`watex` is also used to predict and enhance the :term:`permeability coefficient k` score from geological, 
:term:`borehole`  and logging data by solving  the numerous missing :term:`k` existing in the borehole data (:func:`watex.datasets.load_hlogs`). It implements a novel 
approach called mixture learning strategy (MXS: :class:`watex.methods.MXS`) as the combinaison of the :term:`unsupervised learning` ( K-Means and HAC algorithmns) 
and  :term:`supervised learning` ( SVMs and Xtreme Gradient Boosting) methodologies for reducing the numerous unsucessful 
pumping tests. Here is a ready-made BibTeX:

    journal={Engineering Geology},

In most situations where :code:`watex` is cited, a citation to `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html#citing-scikit-learn>`_ would also be appropriate.
