# texture-courier

program that rips texture cache from second life viewers

## goals

- work on all platforms (that support pip)
- be as fast as possible
- no dependencies

## non goals

texture-courier should not transform or present the cache in any way. we output
things as they are. that means no gui, and no bells and whistles.

## install & use

```
pip install texture-courier

texture-courier /Users/meri/Library/Caches/Firestorm_x64/texturecache
```

this dumps the contents of the cache folder to the provided folder (default
`./texturecache`).

these files will be in j2c, a jpeg2000 derivative. many programs and operating
systems do not read this natively, and may need conversion. you may want to use
a utility to convert these. [graphicsmagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org) is a
good place to start.

use `texture-courier -h` for other options.
