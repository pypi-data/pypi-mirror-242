`dcmri` is the authorative python package for perfusion MRI. 

For more detail please see the [documentation](https://osipi.github.io/pypi/).

`osipi` is developed by the Open Source Initiative for Perfusion Imaging [OSIPI](www.osipi.org), an initiative of the perfusion study group of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine [ISMRM](www.ismrm.org). 

The `osipi` package structure and logic follows the [lexicon](https://osipi.github.io/OSIPI_CAPLEX/) defined by OSIPI, and wraps around selected implementations collected in the [code contributions](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection) of OSIPI.
