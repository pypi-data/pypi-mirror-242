Weâ€™ve provided a brief guide below that shows precisely how the Best Buy Scraper functions with specific code examples that will help you understand and use the scraper hassle-free.

### How it works

You can get Best Buy results by providing your own URLs to our service. We can return the HTML of any Best Buy page you like.

#### Python code example

The example below illustrates how you can get an eBay product page result in HTML format.

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint

# Structure payload.
payload = {
    'source': 'universal_ecommerce',
    'url': 'https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-z-flip4-128gb-unlocked-graphite/6512618.p?skuId=6512618',
    'geo_location': 'United States',
    'parse': True,
}

# Get response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('user', 'pass1'),
    json=payload,
)

# Instead of response with job status and results url, this will return the
# JSON response with the result.
pprint(response.json())
```
