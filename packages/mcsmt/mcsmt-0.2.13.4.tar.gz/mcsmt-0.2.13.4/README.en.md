## How to Run

.whl File:
```bash
pip install <whl file path> --force-reinstall
```
New versions can only be installed using .whl/.tar.gz

**2023/9/7 Update: Full support for MCSMTApi, start with MCSMT CLI**

## Server Side

1. First, generate the server configuration with `python -m mcsmt server genconf`

2.1. Static Server Side

2.1.1. Run `python -m mcsmt server gen`, package and send it after generation, then upload it to the server

2.2. Dynamic Server Side

2.2.1. Directly start `python -m http.server <port>` to start a convenient server (2023/9/7 Change: The built-in simple server has been removed, please use Python's own server or IIS, etc.)

2.2.3. Automatically generated: Start `python -m mcsmt server wdgen` to automatically detect changes in files and generate them (currently unstable)

## Client
Write a `Cconfig.json` like this:
```json
{
    "requestURL": "http://api.example.com/"
}
```
Start `python -m mcsmt client main` to sync
