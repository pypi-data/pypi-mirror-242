# tortoise-orm-stubs

Type stubs that make **tortoise-orm** a bit easier to work with when using type checkers.

Specifically, data fields' types automatically reflect the value of null argument (i.e. become optional if you set null=True)

## Installation

`pip install tortoise-orm-stubs`

## Disclaimer

Previously **tortoise-orm-stubs** provided a lot more value but now the majority of its functionality has become a part of **tortoise-orm**. Hopefully, it will become completely unnecessary in the future.
