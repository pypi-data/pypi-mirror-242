# Game state machine
Game State Machine is a wrapper class set of Python classes and modules
that help manage game and game states. For instance, during game running
you would need several states (splash screen, loading screen,
menu screen, lobby screen etc.), so you can easily manage all of them
by creating classes from BaseGameState
