# API Assistant

The API assistant is a [ChatGPT assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) on top of an OpenAI IDL json file.
The CLI will based on prompts find the correct request and send it with the provided arguments. 

You can run the CLI from your terminal with
```bash
api-chat --idl=<OPENAI_IDL_PATH>
```

## Installation
The tool is available at [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/api-assistant/) and can be installed using pip
```bash
pip install api-assistant
```
### Extra - convert a swagger to OpenAI IDL
If you have generated a swagger (OpenAPI) for you API then you can use the s2o (swagger to openai) tool to convert it to a OpenAI IDL format. The tool can be installed with the cargo CLI that follows the [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) installation. 

If you have cargo installed then you can install it with
```bash
cargo install s2o
```
