# ipython-rtlogging
## Ipython Real Time Logging
`ipython-rtlogging` is a tool that relies only on the Python standard library (except for IPython, Rich) and is used to capture and log the output streams of cells in real-time within IPython or IPython Notebook. It provides an optional solution to tackle the problem of losing cell outputs or not being able to monitor the progress of a running code after reconnecting to the Notebook.
