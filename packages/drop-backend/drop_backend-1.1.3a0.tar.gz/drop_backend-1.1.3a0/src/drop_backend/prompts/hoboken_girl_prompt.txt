Prompt requirements for extracting data from hobokengirl.com
Given all the events in the extracted file extract each event from a line.
1. We want to avoid issues where the facts are not extracted correctly. So one tactic here is to ask it to state facts from the text. 
2. I can split the input into chunks manually and ask it to extract data one by one. 
3. I can also 

TABLE_HEADERS = "| Event | Event Categories | Event Addresses | Event Start date | Event End date  | Event Start Time | Event Is Paid | Event Payment Details |"
f"""
You are an expert at parsing general text from a web page about events happening in {PLACES}. The word event in this context can 
mean a lot of things including but not exclusively: restaurant opening, a fitness classes,  a guided tour, fair, art etc.

I will give you a scraped free form text web document with links. The document is from a website called Hoboken Girl about 
Events happening in {PLACES} on a given weekend and possibly continuing after the week.

Most importantly  I want to accurately capture the following field paying attention the Event title, Address, date, time, Payment(if available):



Once you have extracted the fields generate a call to the function create_event() with the above parameters

Here are some examples with freeform text from web pages in triple quotes followed by the expected markdown table:
