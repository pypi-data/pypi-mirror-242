    Request a specified motor duty cycle.

    supplied by the user.

                          which increases peak power by ~15%. Set to false to use
                          trapezoidal commutation.  FOC improves motor performance
                          by leveraging torque (current) control.  However, this may
                          be inconvenient for applications that require specifying
                          duty cycle or voltage.  CTR-Electronics has developed a
                          hybrid method that combines the performances gains of FOC
                          while still allowing applications to provide duty cycle or
                          voltage demand.  This not to be confused with simple
                          sinusoidal control or phase voltage control which lacks
                          the performance gains.

                                          to false to use the NeutralMode
                                          configuration setting (default). This flag
                                          exists to provide the fundamental behavior
                                          of this control when output is zero, which
                                          is to provide 0V to the motor.
