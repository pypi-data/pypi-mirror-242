class Command:
    """
    Primary command for the application.

    A primary command will usually have multiple subcommands it can
    run.  The typical command line interface is like:

    .. code-block:: none

       <command> [command-options] <subcommand> [subcommand-options]

    :class:`Subcommand` will contain most of the logic, in terms of
    what actually happens when it runs.  Top-level commands are mostly
    a stub for sake of logically grouping the subcommands.

    :param config: Optional config object to use.

       Usually a command is being ran via actual command line, and
       there is no config object yet so it must create one.  (It does
       this within its :meth:`run()` method.)

       But if you already have a config object you can specify it here
       and it will be used instead.

    :param name: Optional value to assign to :attr:`name`.  Usually
       this is declared within the command class definition, but if
       needed it can be provided dynamically.

    :param stdout: Optional replacement to use for :attr:`stdout`.

    :param stderr: Optional replacement to use for :attr:`stderr`.

    :param subcommands: Optional dictionary to use for
       :attr:`subcommands`, instead of loading those via entry points.

    The base class serves as the primary ``wutta`` command for
    WuttJamaican.  Most apps will subclass this and register their own
    top-level command, and create subcommands as needed.

    To do that, first create your Command class, and a ``main()``
    entry point function for it (e.g. in ``poser/commands.py``)::

       import sys
       from wuttjamaican.commands import Command

       class Poser(Command):
           name = 'poser'
           description = 'my custom top-level command'
           version = '0.1'

       def poser_main(*args):
           args = list(args) or sys.argv[1:]
           cmd = Poser()
           cmd.run(*args)

    Then register the ``main()`` entry point(s) in your ``setup.cfg``.
    The command name should be "one word" (no spaces) but may include
    hyphens or underscore etc.

    You can register more than one top-level command if needed; these
    could refer to the same ``main()`` function (in which case they
    are really aliases) or can use different functions:

    .. code-block:: ini

       [options.entry_points]
       console_scripts =
           poser = poser.commands:poser_main
           wutta-poser = poser.commands:wutta_poser_main

    Next time your (``poser``) package is installed, the command will be
    available, so you can e.g.:

    .. code-block:: sh

       cd /path/to/venv
       bin/poser --help
       bin/wutta-poser --help

    And see :class:`Subcommand` for info about adding those.

    .. attribute::  name

       Name of the primary command, e.g. ``wutta``

    .. attribute:: description

       Description of the app itself or the primary command.

    .. attribute:: version

       Version string for the app or primary command.

    .. attribute:: stdout

       Reference to file-like object which should be used for writing
       to STDOUT.  By default this is just ``sys.stdout``.

    .. attribute:: stderr

       Reference to file-like object which should be used for writing
       to STDERR.  By default this is just ``sys.stderr``.

    .. attribute:: subcommands

       Dictionary of available subcommand classes, keyed by subcommand
       name.  These are usually loaded from setuptools entry points.

    about or try to use this yourself.  It will be used automatically

class Subcommand:
    """
    Base class for application subcommands.

    Subcommands are where the real action happens.  Each must define
    the :meth:`run()` method with whatever logic is needed.  They can
    also define :meth:`add_args()` to expose options.

    Subcommands always belong to a top-level command - the association
    is made by way of entry point registration, and the constructor
    for this class.

    :param command: Reference to top-level :class:`Command` object.

    Note that unlike :class:`Command`, the base ``Subcommand`` does
    not correspond to any real subcommand for WuttJamaican.  (It's
    *only* a base class.)  For a real example see
    :class:`~wuttjamaican.commands.setup.Setup`.

    In your project you can define new subcommands for any top-level
    command.  For instance to add a ``hello`` subcommand to the
    ``poser`` command example (cf. :class:`Command` docs):

    First create a Subcommand class (e.g. by adding to
    ``poser/commands.py``)::

       from wuttjamaican.commands import Subcommand

       class Hello(Subcommand):
           \"""
           Say hello to the user
           \"""
           name = 'hello'
           description = __doc__.strip()

           def add_args(self):
               self.parser.add_argument('--foo', default='bar', help="Foo value")

           def run(self, args):
               print("hello, foo value is:", args.foo)

    You may notice there is nothing in that subcommand definition
    which ties it to the ``poser`` top-level command.  That is done by
    way of another entry point in your ``setup.cfg`` file.

    As with top-level commands, you can "alias" the same subcommand so
    it appears under multiple top-level commands.  Note that if the
    top-level command name contains a hyphen, that must be replaced
    with underscore for sake of the subcommand entry point:

    .. code-block:: ini

       [options.entry_points]
       poser.subcommands =
           hello = poser.commands:Hello
       wutta_poser.subcommands =
           hello = poser.commands:Hello

    Next time your (``poser``) package is installed, the subcommand
    will be available, so you can e.g.:

    .. code-block:: sh

       cd /path/to/venv
       bin/poser hello --help
       bin/wutta-poser hello --help

        self.stderr = self.command.stderr

           the subcommand arg parser.

        The ``args`` should have values for everything setup in
        :meth:`add_args()`.  For example if you added the ``--foo``
        arg then here in ``run()`` you can do::

        For a command line like ``bin/poser hello --foo=baz`` then,
        you might do this::
