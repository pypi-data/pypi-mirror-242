# This setting applies to Windows, only.
# Background: When a venv is created in Git Bash on Windows, the
# Scripts/activate script defines a VIRTUAL_ENV path that contains both
# "/" and "\\" path separators. That can cause unexpected errors. Set
# fix-new-venvs to true to correct the VIRTUAL_ENV path whenever a new
# venv is created.
fix-new-venvs = true

# Upgrade the PIP module after venv creation?
upgrade-pip = true

# The name prefix to use for new venvs unless an explicit venv name is
# provided on the command line:
venv-prefix = ".venv"
# Note: You CAN specify an absolute path here, or a relative path e.g.
# ../somewhere/.venv
# but that doesn't mean you should. Using anything but the CWD for the
# prefix is unsupported and untested.

# Append the version number of the Python interpreter to the venv-prefix.
# This setting has no effect if the --version command line option is
# present or if an explicit venv name is provided on the command line.
append-version = true
