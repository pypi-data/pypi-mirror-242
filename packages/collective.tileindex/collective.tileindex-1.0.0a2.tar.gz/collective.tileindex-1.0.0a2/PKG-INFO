        An add-on for Plone
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Catalog index that tells you which tiles are in use.
          Think of Mosaic or collective.cover, or any package that builds on ``plone.app.blocks``.
        - ``tile-types-view`` for a page, showing which tiles this page uses.
        - ``tile-types-overview`` for the Plone site root, with a total for the whole site, including search results for individual tiles.
        
        
        Documentation

        The documentation is this README file.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install collective.tileindex by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                collective.tileindex
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``.
        Go to the Add-ons control panel to activate it.
        This goes through the whole Plone Site and updates the index for items with the ``plone.layoutaware`` behavior.
