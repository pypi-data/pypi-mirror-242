  <em>A Flexible Service Locator for Python.</em>
</p>
<!-- begin index -->

*svcs* (pronounced *services*) is a **dependency container** for Python.
It gives you a central place to register factories for types/interfaces and then imperatively acquire instances of those types with **automatic cleanup** and **health checks**.

It's suitable for implementing [Inversion of Control](https://svcs.hynek.me/en/latest/glossary.html#term-Inversion-of-Control) using either **dependency injection** or **service location** while not requiring global state, decorators, or mangling of function signatures.

<!-- begin benefits -->
Benefits:

- Eliminates tons of repetitive **boilerplate** code,
- unifies **acquisition** and **cleanups** of services,
- provides full *static* **type safety** for them,
- simplifies **testing** through **loose coupling**,
- improves *live* **introspection** and **monitoring** with **health checks**.

The goal is to minimize the code for acquiring pluggable services to:

<!-- end index -->
<!-- end benefits -->

<!--
; skip: next
-->

```python
from svcs.your_framework import svcs_from

def view(request):
    db, api, cache = svcs_from(request).get(Database, WebAPIClient, Cache)
```

... or less!

<!-- begin addendum -->
To a type checker like [Mypy](https://mypy-lang.org), `db` has the type `Database`, `api` has the type `WebAPIClient`, and `cache` has the type `Cache`.
`db`, `api`, and `cache` will be automatically cleaned up when the request ends -- it's context managers all the way down.
<!-- end addendum -->

*svcs* comes with seamless integration for **AIOHTTP**, **FastAPI**, **Flask**, **Pyramid**, and **Starlette**.

<!-- begin typing -->
While *svcs* also has first-class support for static typing, it is **strictly optional** and will always remain so.
*svcs* also doesn't check your types at runtime.
It only forwards the type you have asked for to the type checker.
If you don't use a type checker, that information is ignored without any runtime overhead.
<!-- end typing -->

## Release Information

### Changed

- **Backwards-Incompatible**: Since multiple people have been bit by the `enter=True` default for `Registry.register_value()`, and it's very early in *svcs* life, we're changing the default to `enter=False` for all versions of `register_value()`.

  This means that you have to explicitly opt-in to context manager behavior which makes a lot more sense for singletons like connection pools which are the most common candidates for registered values.

  (The irony of shipping a backwards-incompatible change in the release directly following the adoption of a backwards-compatibility policy not lost on me.)
  [#50](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/discussions/50)
  [#51](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/51)


### Added

- Container-local registries!
  Sometimes it's useful to bind a value or factory only to a container.
  For example, request metadata or authentication information.

  You can now achieve that with `svcs.Container.register_local_factory()` and `svcs.Container.register_local_value()`.
  Once something local is registered, a registry is transparently created and it takes precedence over the global one when a service is requested.
  The local registry is closed together with the container.
  [#56](https://github.com/hynek/issues/pull/56)

- Flask: `svcs.flask.registry` which is a `werkzeug.local.LocalProxy` for the currently active registry on `flask.current_app`.


### Fixed

- We've stopped rewriting the public names of our objects and `typing.get_type_hints()` now works on them as expected for Python 3.10 and later.
  [#52](https://github.com/hynek/issues/pull/52)
  [#53](https://github.com/hynek/issues/pull/53)

- The detection of container arguments in `svcs.Registry()` when using string-based type annotations is more robust now.
