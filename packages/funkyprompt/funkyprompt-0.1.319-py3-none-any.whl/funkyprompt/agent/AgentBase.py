    Plans are basically elements of Strategies: what describe as an Agent is a strategy and there is a question of how strategies decompose
    we are completely functional except for how the interpreter works
    some functions such as checking session history are still functional
    examples of things this should be able to do
    - Look for or take in functions and answer any question with no extra prompting and nudging. Examples based on ops we have
    - we should be able to run a planning prompt where the agent switches into saying what it would do e.g. rating functions, graph building, planning
    - we should be able to construct complex execution flows e.g.
      - parallel function calls
      - saving compiled new functions i.e. motifs that are often used
      - asking the user for more input
      - evolution of specialists

    If it turns out we need to branch into specialist agents we can do so by overriding the default prompt but we are trying to avoid that on principle
