# [TerminalGPT-Pro]


Welcome to TerminalGPT-Pro, the terminal-based ChatGPT personal assistant app!
With TerminalGPT-Pro, you can easily interact with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 language models.

Whether you need help with a quick question or want to explore a complex topic, TerminalGPT-Pro is here to assist you. Simply enter your query and TerminalGPT-Pro will provide you with the best answer possible based on its extensive knowledge base.


## Why?

Some advantages of using TerminalGPT-Pro over the chatGPT browser-based app:

- It doesn't disconnect like the browser-based app, so you can leave it running in a terminal session on the side without losing context.
- It's highly available and can be used whenever you need it.
- It's faster with replies than the browser-based app.
- You can use TerminalGPT-Pro with your IDE terminal, which means you won't have to constantly switch between your browser and your IDE when you have questions.
- TerminalGPT-Pro's answers are tailored to your machine's operating system, distribution, and chip-set architecture
- Doesn't use your conversation data for training the model (unlike the browser-based app).
- Your conversations are stored locally on your machine, so only you can access them.

## Pre-requisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- An OpenAI Account and API key.
   1. Sign up at <https://beta.openai.com/signup> using email or Google/Microsoft account.

```

2. Now you have `terminalgpt` command available in your terminal. Run the following install command to configure the app.

```sh

```

3. Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted and press enter.

4. Choose one of the models below as the default model. it can be overridden with the `-m --model` flag later.

5.  Choose a printing style ('markdown' is recommended)

That's it! You're ready to use TerminalGPT!
