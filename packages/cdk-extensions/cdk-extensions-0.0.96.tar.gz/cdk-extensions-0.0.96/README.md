# Vibe.io

Vibe.io CDK extensions is a library of opinionated CDK constructs that will accelerate your project by laying a solid cloud foundation for your team to build on top of. Keeping your team focused on business value, while relying on a community to manage the common fundamentals like VPC, EKS, Cross Account Management, etc.

# Meet the Maintainers

[RightBrain Networks](https://www.rightbrainnetworks.com/) has spent the past decade forging cloud patterns, working with startups and enterprise clients to find the sweet spot where cloud infrastructure sits in a Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC). Identifying the right amount of self-service to unblock development, but with the right amount of support from operations to ensure we're building a secure, and auditable platform. We've found that the CDK construct library pattern lends itself in line with our goals, and provides a framework for adoption that enables us to share our work with the cloud operations community.

We are confident in our vision that Infrastructure as Code should follow an [Environments as Cattle approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5XDAhyh9Z4). We've attempted to open source our patterns many times throughout the years, by way of CloudFormation repositories and troposphere initiatives and the like. CDK broke this wide open for us. We're able to develop and iterate on our patterns with true imperative code, that can be imported as a library by a consumer and used as necessary.

## Getting Started

### TypeScript

#### Installation

```shell
$ npm install cdk-extensions
```

### Python

#### Installation

```shell
$ pip install cdk-extensions
```

### Examples

#### AwsLoggingStack

Minimal deployable example creates the default logging strategy defined in [AwsLoggingStack](src/stacks/README.md#awsloggingstack) for Elastic Load Balancer, CloudFront, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, S3 access logs, SES logs, and WAF logs. For each service, an S3 bucket is created and a Glue crawler to analyze and categorize the data and store the associated metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Default named queries have been defined for each AWS service. For more details on this and the other available stacks and constructs, consult the respective READMEs.

**TypeScript**

```TypeScript
import { AwsLoggingStack } from 'cdk-extensions/stacks';
```

```TypeScript
new AwsLoggingStack(this, 'AwsLoggingStack')
```

**Python**

```Python
from cdk_extensions.stacks import (
  AwsLoggingStack
)
```

```Python
aws_logging_stack = AwsLoggingStack(self, 'AwsLoggingStack')
```

#### Deploy

```shell
$ cdk deploy
```

## CDK-Extensions Design Principles

### All **cdk-extensions** constructs should

* Expose their configurations so other resources can make informed
  decisions about the resource itâ€™s working on.
* Be fully compatible with **aws-cdk-lib** constructs
* Expose every single field in the resources, so they can be configured

  * In some cases, this may rely on custom features built into the **cdk-extensions**
    constructs, to allow configuration of Cfn fields not normally exposed by CDK
  * Anything that can be configured on a resource should be something that can
    be customized using CDK
* However, all fields have sane defaults, following best practices(i.e most secure way)

  * Using the most secure settings should be a feature one opts out of, not the
    other way around
  * We should be able to launch constructs that adhere to best practices without
    a lot of customization
