Support has been added to create geodetic representations not just for existing ellipsoids
from ERFA, but also with explicitly provided values, by defining a subclass of
``BaseGeodeticRepresentation`` with the equatorial radius and flattening assigned to
``_equatorial_radius`` and ``_flattening`` attributes.
