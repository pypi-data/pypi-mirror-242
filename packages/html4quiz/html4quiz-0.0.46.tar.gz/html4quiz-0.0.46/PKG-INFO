# html4quiz

## What is it?

html4quiz is a package that helps you generate question sheets with as many HTML files as you want and grade answers from text files submitted by students.

## Features
<ul>
<li><strong>Local</strong>: Everything is on your local PC, grows with your creativity, and you own everything, unlike the many quiz generators available online.</li>
<li><strong>HTML files</strong>: Question sheets in HTML files, each named with a corresponding identification number, are distributed to students over the network.</li>
<ul><li>Each HTML file is complete in itself with everything included.</li>
<li>Students use their mobile devices to read, answer questions, save answers to a text file for submission within the same HTML page, and submit the text file as directed over the network.</li>
<li>Answers can be changed, and saving answers to a text file can be repeated as many times as desired until the file is submitted.</li></ul>
<li><strong>Easy grading</strong>: Grade answers in text files submitted by all students can be achieved with a few keystrokes.</li>
<li><strong>Two kinds of HTML files</strong></li>
<ol><li>First kind is to preview questions before generating sheets.</li>
<li>Second kind is the set of sheets.</li></ol>
<li><strong>Three kinds of questions</strong></li>
<ol><li>Short answr questions of requiring a number of a word.</li>
<li>Multiple choice questions whose choices are genterated randomly by one of various methods or by Python coding.</li>
<li>Unlike the previous two kinds, students have to "play" the simulation provided with question to answer (refer to <a href="https://generatenscore.github.io/html4quiz/Examples/Ex005/Ex005/Ex005/index.html">Ex005 Preview</a>).</li></ol>
<li><strong>Figures</strong> as well as <strong>mathematical expressions</strong> in LaTeX format can be included in both question texts and choices.</li>
<li><strong>Randomness</strong> is controlled completely by users with Python scripts.</li>
<li><strong>Easy correction</strong>: When some answers are found incorrect after question sheets are distributed, the answers can be corrected by simply re-generate the sheets with the "work" pickle file (refer to Version 0.0.29). </li></ul>
