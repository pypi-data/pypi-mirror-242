"""Package grscheller.datastructures.core

Data modules supporting core infrastructure of grscheller.datastructures.

- grscheller.datastructures.core.fp
  - data structures supporting a functional style of programming in Python
    - immutable semantics - map & flatMap always return modified copies
    - None is always treated as a non-existance value
      - Python None value cannot be stored in any object in this subpackage
      - semantically None does not exist
      - None is used as an implementration detail

- grscheller.datastructures.core.iterlib iterator module
  - functions similar to itertools and more-itertools
    - will use itertools over these since they are C language builtins
    - not using PyPI more-itertools to avoid external dependencies

- grscheller.datastructures.core.carray module implementing a circular array
  - used in the implementation of several other data structures
  - None freely stored in this data structure
  - decided to not make private because
    - could be of utility on its own
    - could be of use for users to create their own data structures
