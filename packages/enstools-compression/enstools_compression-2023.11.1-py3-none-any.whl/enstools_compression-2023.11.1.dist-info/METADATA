# enstools-compression [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/enstools/badge/?version=latest)](https://enstools-compression.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


This package extends [enstools](github.com/wavestoweather/enstools) to enable **lossy** and **lossless** compression 
by using **HDF5 filters**.

Also, it contains a set of tools to help to find appropriate compression specifications.
It includes a **Command Line Interface** to access its features from the command line

For example:
```bash
enstools-compression compress "input.nc" -o "output.nc" --compression "lossless"
```

It has been developed under the [Waves to Weather - Transregional Collaborative Research 
Project (SFB/TRR165)](https://wavestoweather.de).
