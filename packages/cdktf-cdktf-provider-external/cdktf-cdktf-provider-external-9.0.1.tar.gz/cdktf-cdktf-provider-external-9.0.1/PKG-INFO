## Versioning

This project is explicitly not tracking the Terraform external Provider version 1:1. In fact, it always tracks `latest` of `~> 2.1` with every release. If there are scenarios where you explicitly have to pin your provider version, you can do so by generating the [provider constructs manually](https://cdk.tf/imports).

These are the upstream dependencies:

* [Terraform CDK](https://cdk.tf)
* [Terraform external Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/external/2.3.2)

  * This links to the minimum version being tracked, you can find the latest released version [in our releases](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-provider-external/releases)
* [Terraform Engine](https://terraform.io)

If there are breaking changes (backward incompatible) in any of the above, the major version of this project will be bumped.

## Features / Issues / Bugs
