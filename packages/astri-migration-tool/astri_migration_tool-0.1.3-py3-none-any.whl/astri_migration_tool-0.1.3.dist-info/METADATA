## Introduction


Major features:

1. **XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX**:

   - Supports training different tasks with a small amount of code, e.g., ImageNet can be trained with only 80 lines of code (400 lines of the original PyTorch example).
   - Easily compatible with models from popular algorithm libraries such as TIMM, TorchVision, and Detectron2.

2. **XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX**:

   - Handles different algorithm tasks with unified APIs, e.g., implement a method and apply it to all compatible models.
   - Provides a unified abstraction for upper-level algorithm libraries, which supports various back-end devices such as Nvidia CUDA, Mac MPS, AMD, MLU, and more for model training.

3. **XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX**:

   - Defines the training process just like playing with Legos.
   - Provides rich components and strategies.
   - Complete controls on the training process with different levels of APIs.
