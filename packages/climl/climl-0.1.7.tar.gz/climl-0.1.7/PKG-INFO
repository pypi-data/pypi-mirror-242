# Overview

## What is CLIML?

**CLIML** is a CLI tool that rapidly automates the creation of powerful supervised learning models:

- Auto-detection for regression/classification tasks.
- Automated hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
- Train models as quickly (or as extensively) as you like.
- Make easy predictions and output them to a CSV file.
- Beautifully formatted `--help` if you get stuck.

## Who is CLIML for?

- Anyone who has some data and wants a quick, accessible way to apply ML.
- Data scientists who want to accelerate their ML prototyping workflows.

# Installing CLIML

## 1. Pre-Requisites

- Python >=3.11, <4.0
- libomp (if using MacOS)

On MacOS, [libomp](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libomp) is required for LightGBM models. You can get libomp by running: `brew install libomp`.

## 2. Pip Install

Enter the following into the command line in your chosen directory:

```console
$ pip install climl
```

# Using CLIML

## 1. Getting Data

You can't do machine learning without some properly formatted data. 

1. Make sure it's a rectangular dataset (like you'd get in Excel).
2. Ensure that your dataset has column headers.
3. Put the output you want to start predicting in the final column.
4. Save your dataset as a CSV file. (Excel coming soon!)
5. Navigate to where the file is saved via the command line (`ls` and `cd` are your friends).

That's as complicated as it gets! Now you're ready to do some Machine Learning.

## 2. Training a Model

You can train a powerful ML model using just *four* words (in seconds) :

```console
$ climl train dataset.csv num_of_seconds
```

This will tell **CLIML** to ... 

1. Detect whether the final column in `dataset.csv` is numerical or categorical.
2. Begin training multiple regression or classification models, respectively.
3. Continue tuning hyperparameters for your specified `num_of_seconds`.
4. Display the most accurate model and its hyperparameters to the terminal.
5. Save your model as an `.climl` file.

If you enter `ls` you'll be able to see your newly trained `dataset.climl` model!

## 3. Inspecting a Model

Forgot what type of model you trained? Interested in telling everyone about its hyperparameters? You'll only need *three* words this time:

```console
$ climl inspect dataset.climl
```

This will output the model's type, hyperparameters, accuracy, and time taken to discover

## 4. Making Predictions

Annoyingly you'll need *four* whole words again. 

Firstly, make sure that your `things_to_predict.csv` file is formatted exactly like the CSV file which `model.climl` was trained on - just **without** the final output column!

Then run:

```
$ climl predict things_to_predict.csv model.climl
```

This will:
1. Display a prediction of the outputs for whatever inputs are in `things_to_predict.csv` 
2. Append a new column to `things_to_predict.csv`, with the header "Predicted Outputs"

## 5. Errors and `--help`

If you enter something incorrect, **CLIML** is pretty good at telling you why. For instance, if you enter:

```console
$ climl train data.csv
```

You should see something like this:
![Command Line Error Message](error.png)
It looks like you didn't specify a training time!

If you're still a bit stuck, you can always enter one of the following:

- `climl --help`
- `climl train --help`
- `climl inspect --help`
- `climl predict --help`

To get something like this:

# Roadmap

Here are some things on the roadmap: 

- Train and send predictions to an Excel file
- Timeseries problems
- Multi-output models
- Automated data-cleaning
- Plotting functionality

# FAQs

**What models does CLIML train?**

**CLIML** runs its model selection algorithm on: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Extra_Tree, Logistic Regressions with L1 and L2 Regularization, CatBoost, KNeighbours

**How long to specify for training?**

Depending on your dataset, start small (<20 seconds), then lengthen until you notice accuracy starts to taper off or if it's "good enough"!

**Do I need a super-powerful computer?**

No! **CLIML** is suited for devices with low computational resource. But there are limits to everything!
