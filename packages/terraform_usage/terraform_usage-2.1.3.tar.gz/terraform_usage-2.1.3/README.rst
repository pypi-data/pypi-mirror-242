Execution Modes
---------------

- Simple
    - Function
        - Get total number of Runs and successful Applies for all time.
    - Available filters
        - Workspace name pattern
    - Pros and cons
        - Faster execution
        - Less details

- Advanced
    - Function
        - Get total number of Runs, successful Applies, and total Run time.
    - Available filters
        - Workspace name pattern
        - Start date
        - End date
    - Pros and cons
        - Potentially slower execution for a large number of Workspaces and Runs.
        - More details

Error Handling
--------------

- Error: Skipping run due to missing attribute(s).
    - A Run is missing a timestamp for a status. Normally caused by Runs stuck in Pending state, which should be discarded if they aren't meant to complete, successfully or otherwise.
- Error: One or more Python exceptions.
    - Multiple possible causes. One of the most common is due to the script hitting the Terraform Cloud API rate limit (30 requests per second). There is a safeguard that slows down execution to avoid this.
