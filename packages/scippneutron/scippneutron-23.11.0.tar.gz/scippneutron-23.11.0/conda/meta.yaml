# The conda documentation recommends placing version number in the
# conda_build_config.yaml file, instead of directly in this meta.yaml file:
# https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/variants.html
# It seems the primary advantage of doing this is that it allows matrix builds from a
# single conda-build command.
# For now, the only matrix-style building we are doing is the python version,
# which is set via the `--python` command line argument anyway, because we are
# parallelising our CI builds.
# A matrix build from conda-build directly would have to perform the lib solving for
# each version, and using multiple workers on our CI is faster than building all python
# versions in a single conda-build step.
