# Matrixlib

---
### A basic library for matrix and vector operations. Any feedback is highly encouraged. I enjoy trying to create modules and programs that work with mathematical functions and data. I also like looking into higher end modules and researching the processes and programs they use to perform tasks. Any feedback will be taken and acted upon.

# Installation

---
### Use the package manager pip to install matrixlib_jfj.

### Release Versions:

``` bash
pip install matrixlib_jfj
```

### Test Versions:

``` bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple matrixlib-jfj
```
<br>
<br>

# General Usage

---
``` python
import matrixlib_jfj as ml

# matrix = ml.matrix.Matrix(rowcols=(x, y) or values=[[nested list(s) with values assigned]]) Initialises the matrix.
Example:
matrix = ml.matrix.Matrix(rowcols=(3, 3))
>>> [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

print(matrix)
    +-       -+
    | 0  0  0 |
>>> | 0  0  0 |
    | 0  0  0 |
    +-       -+

# matrix.random(a, b) Adds random values to the entire matrix
Example:
matrix.random(1, 10)
    +-          -+
    |7    10   7 |
>>> |1    1    7 |
    |10   5    8 |
    +-          -+

# matrix.identity() Creates an identity matrix from an existing square matrix
    +-       -+
    |1   0   0|
>>> |0   1   0|
    |0   0   1|
    +-       -+

### Adding ###
matrix1 = ml.matrix.Matrix(values=[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
])

matrix2 = ml.matrix.Matrix(values=[
    [9, 8, 7],
    [6, 5, 4],
    [3, 2, 1]
])

    +-          -+
    |10   10   10|
>>> |10   10   10|
    |10   10   10|
    +-          -+
```
