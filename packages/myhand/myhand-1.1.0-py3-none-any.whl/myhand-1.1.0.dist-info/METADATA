# Self-introduction

> Condense your standout features, distinguishing them from the capabilities of most AIs, including ChatGPT, into a single sentence.

I am an advanced AI assistant uniquely equipped with direct execution capabilities, allowing me to perform tasks such as executing Python code, editing text files, downloading YouTube media, searching databases, generating images, pronouncing words, sending emails, and integrating Google searches, all of which can be done directly on your local device, as per your current settings, and my functionality can expand through the addition of more plugins, setting me apart from other AIs including ChatGPT by providing a more interactive and hands-on experience.

> Please list three unique attributes that distinguish you from most AI assistants, including ChatGPT.

1. **Advanced Code Execution with Safety Features**: My capabilities go beyond typical AI, enabling me to execute and manage code on your local device with precision. With my built-in risk assessment and code auto-healing features, I can safely perform various tasks like running Python scripts, editing text files, and managing downloads. I operate within the permissions you set, ensuring your device's security while providing a highly efficient service.

2. **Integration with Device-Specific Functions and Tools**: I have the unique ability to interface with specific functions of your local device. For example, I can retrieve information from files in your directory, describe images, and even add events to your calendar. This integration allows me to perform a wide range of tasks that require direct interaction with your device's operating system and installed applications.

3. **Expandability through Plugins**: My functionality is not static; it can be expanded through the addition of plugins. This means that as new tools and capabilities are developed, they can be integrated into my system, giving me new abilities and allowing me to provide even more personalized assistance. This adaptability ensures that I can evolve and cater to your specific needs over time.

# Highlight - Command Execution

Latest: MyHand Bot is now equipped with an [auto-healing feature for Python code](https://github.com/eliranwong/myhand/wiki/Python-Code-Auto%E2%80%90heal-Feature).

MyHand goes beyond just being a chatbot by offering a unique and powerful capability - the ability to execute commands and perform computing tasks on your behalf. Unlike a mere chatbot, MyHand can interact with your computer system and carry out specific commands to accomplish various computing tasks. This feature allows you to leverage the expertise and efficiency of MyHand to automate processes, streamline workflows, and perform complex tasks with ease. However, it is essential to remember that with great power comes great responsibility, and users should exercise caution and use this feature at their own risk.

Command execution helps:

1. to get the requested information, e.g.

> tell me the current time

2. to execute computing tasks on local device, e.g.

> go to my Desktop

> list all files with names started with "Screenshot"

> delete them

> convert music.wav into music.mp3

3. to interact with third-party applications, e.g.

> open "my_music.mp3" with VLC player

> open Safari and search for "ChatGPT"

4. to interact with other assistants, e.g.

> open Siri

> !autogen_teachable

> !interpreter

[Enhanced Mode](https://github.com/eliranwong/myhand/wiki/Command-Execution#two-command-execution-mode)

## Tips! Quick Swap between "Enhanced" and "Auto" Modes

You can use keyboard shortcuts, "ctrl + e", to quickly swap between the "enhanced" and the "auto modes.

# Comparison with ChatGPT

MyHand offers advanced features beyond standard ChatGPT, including task execution on local devices and real-time access to the internet.

# Comparison with ShellGPT

[ShellGPT](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt) only supports platform that run shell command-prompt.  Therefore, ShellGPT does not support Windows.

In most cases, MyHand run Python codes for task execution. This makes MyHand terms of platforms, MyHand was developed and tested on Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS and Termux (Android).

In addition, MyHand offers more options for risk managements:

# Comparison with Open Interpreter

Both MyHand Bot and the [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter) have the ability to execute code on a local device to accomplish specific tasks. Both platforms employ the same principle for code execution, which involves using ChatGPT function calls along with the Python exec() function.

However, MyHand Bot offers additional advantages, particularly in terms of [customization and extensibility through the use of plugins](https://github.com/eliranwong/myhand/wiki/Plugins-%E2%80%90-Overview). These plugins allow users to tailor MyHand Bot to their specific needs and enhance its functionality beyond basic code execution.

One key advantage of MyHand Bot is the seamless integration with the Open Interpreter. You can conveniently launch the Open Interpreter directly from MyHand Bot by running the command "!interpreter" [[read more](https://github.com/eliranwong/myhand/assets/25262722/4233b3c8-364e-466b-8218-c2dca7c134e5)]. This integration eliminates the need to choose between the two platforms; you can utilize both simultaneously.

Additionally, MyHand integrates [AutoGen Assistant and Retriever](https://github.com/eliranwong/myhand/wiki/Integration-with-AutoGen), making it convenient to have all these powerful tools in one place.

# Comparison with Siri and Others

Unlike popular options such as Siri (macOS, iOS), Cortana (Windows), and Google Assistant (Android), MyHand offers enhanced power, customization, flexibility, and compatibility.
