class Profile :
    """
    Class for a chess.com profile.  Upon creation of an object, it scrapes the chess.com API for the profile, stats, current games, and games of a given player, and modifies 
    some of the data to be more useful and accessible.  It also stores the games as Board objects, which can be used to get information about the games and play through the sequence of moves.
    This class also contains the save_info() and load_info() methods which allow for the data to be saved to a "cache" folder, so that the data does not have to be scraped from the API every time, making it much faster.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    username : str
        the given username of the player
    save_mode : bool
        whether to import the data from a file in the "cache" folder (True) or scrape the data from the API (False)
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    username : str
        the given username of the player
    info : dict
        the player's profile, scraped from the chess.com API (including avatar url, player_id, url, name, followers, country, joined and some other basic info)
    stats : dict
        the player's stats, which are scraped from the chess.com API, but then modified in the retrieve_player_stats() method to be more useful and accessible.  The stats include ratings, percentage of games won, lost, and drawn for all game types (daily, rapid, ...)
    current_games_data : list
        the player's current ongoing games, scraped directly from the chess.com API
    games_data : list
        the archived player's games, scraped directly from the chess.com API
    all_games : list
        all of the player's games, stored as Board objects  This is not filtered, and contains all of the player's games, regardless of game type (ex. rapid, bullet, ...)
    current_games : list
        the player's current ongoing games, stored as Board objects
    games : list
        the player's games, stored as Board objects.  This contains a filtered version of the all_games list, filtered by the filter_game_type() method.  By default, this list contains all of the player's games, but can be filtered to only contain rapid games, bullet games, etc. to allow for more specific analysis (ex. analyzing only bullet games to see the player's most popular bullet openings)
    white_games : list
        the subset of the games list that contains only games where the player is white.  This list might be filtered, as it is a subset of the games list
    black_games : list
        the subset of the games list that contains only games where the player is black.  This list might be filtered, as it is a subset of the games list
    
    Methods
    -------
    filter_game_type(type: str)
        filters the games list to only contain games of a given type (ex. "rapid", "bullet", ...), allowing for more specific analysis (ex. analyzing only bullet games to see the player's most popular bullet openings)
    retrieve_player_profile()
        scrapes the chess.com API for the player's profile (which includes avatar url, player_id, url, name, followers, country, joined and some other basic info) and returns it in an accessible JSON format
    calc_pct(numerator: int, denominator: int)
        this method calculates the percentage of an event (ex. bullet games lost) given the numerator and denominator (ex. 2 losses out of 5 games: calc_pct(2, 5) -> 40.0)
    retrieve_player_stats()
        scrapes the player's stats directly from the chess.com API, but then modifies the data and stores it in a dictionary so that the data is more useful and accessible.  This method calculates the win, loss and draw percentages of all game types.  The final stats include ratings, percentage of games won, lost, and drawn for all game types (daily, rapid, ...)
    retrieve_current_games()
        scrapes the player's current ongoing game data directly from the chess.com API.  This data will be used to create the board objects for the current_games_data attribute
    retrieve_player_games()
        scrapes the player's archived game data directly from the chess.com API.  This data will be used to create the board objects for the games_data attribute
    save_info()
        saves the player's profile, stats, current games, and games to a file in the "cache" folder
    load_info()
        loads the player's profile, stats, current games, and games from a file in the "cache" folder.  If the file does not exist, it raises an exception
    find_games_with_FEN(FEN: str)
        finds all of the games that contain a given FEN.  This goes through all of the board objects in games (potentially filtered by filter_game_type()) and checks if they contain the given FEN using their contains_FEN() method.  This method simulates through the entire game and checks if the given FEN matches at any point throughout the game.
    find_games_with_FEN_and_Color(FEN: str, is_white: bool)
        finds all of the games that contain a given FEN and where the player is white (if is_white bool is True) or black (if is_white bool is False) using the find_games_with_FEN() method.
    find_moves_after_FEN(FEN: str, is_white: bool)
        goes through all games, where the player is white (if white bool is True) or black (if is_white bool is False), and finds their most common moves (with frequency) after that FEN.  This method uses the find_games_with_FEN_and_Color() method to find the games, and then uses the getNextMove() method from the Board class to find the next move in the game.  It then sorts the moves and frequencies by frequency using the sortMovesAndFrequencies() method.
    move_table(FEN: str, is_white: bool)
        returns a printable table of the most frequent moves after a given FEN, where the player is white (if is_white bool is True) or black (if is_white bool is False).  This method uses the find_moves_after_FEN() method to find the moves and frequencies, and then formats them into a printable table.
    most_common_move(FEN: str, is_white: bool)
        returns the most frequent move after a given FEN, where the player is white (if is_white bool is True) or black (if is_white bool is False).  This method uses the find_moves_after_FEN() method to find the moves and frequencies, and then returns the first move in the list of moves (which is the most frequent move).
    get_white_games()
        returns a list of all of the games where the player is white (using the games list, which might be filtered)
    get_black_games()
        returns a list of all of the games where the player is black (using the games list, which might be filtered)
