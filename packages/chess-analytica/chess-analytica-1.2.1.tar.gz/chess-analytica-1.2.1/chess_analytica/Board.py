    of the board, as well as the reset method, which resets the board to its original state.  The FEN (Forsyth–Edwards Notation) and next move can be retrieved at any time as well.

    Methods
    -------
    move()

    get_board()
        Returns the board object
    get_FEN()
        Returns the FEN of the board, in its current state
    has_move()
        Returns whether there are moves left in the game
    reset()
        Resets the board to the beginning of the game
    contains_FEN(FEN: str)
        Simulates the board through all moves, checking after each move is made to see if the current FEN of the board matches the given FEN.  If it does, the method returns True.  Otherwise, it returns False.  This method is used to check if the state of the game ever matches a given FEN.
