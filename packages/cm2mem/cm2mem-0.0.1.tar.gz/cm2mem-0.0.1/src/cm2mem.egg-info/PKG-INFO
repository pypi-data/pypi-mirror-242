# cm2mem

To use, initialize a Memory instance. Use massive=False if you're using a ``MassMemory`` and not a ``MassiveMemory``.
Use the Memory class as if it were an array, for example: ``print(mem[123])`` or ``mem[123] = 255``.

You can use the various functions under the ``premade`` class to (quickly) write values to a ``MassiveMemory`` that allow you to use the ``MassiveMemory`` as a multiplier, adder, etc..
**The functions under the ``premade`` class ONLY work with ``MassiveMemory``**

If you need help with anything, feel free to DM me on Discord @animepfp

May break if memory in Circuit Maker 2 is modified. (DM me if that happens, or if you find a bug)
