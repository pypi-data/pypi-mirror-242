Quillix is a Python package designed for local database management using JSON as the underlying storage format. With Quillix, users can seamlessly create, manage, and query databases through a simplified interface. The package provides a convenient way to perform basic database operations, execute SQL-like queries, and manage data with ease.

Usage

import quillix as qx
qx.query("your query")

    Note: 1. "Alter table" has only column based operations which include "drop", "rename", "add".
          2. In "update table" syntax, "column1 = column1 + value" is written as "column1 + value".
          3. Syntax does not include semi-colon(;) in the end.
          4. Enclose conditions after "where" keyword with brackets.
                Example, "select * from table_name where ((column1 > 5) or (column2 == hello world))"
          5. while using "group by" or "order by" clause, no need to mention the grouping or sorting columns in the column details between "select" and "from" keyword.
          6. "Join" does not work, however you can use object based syntax.
                Example, "select count(b.col4) from a testTable, b testTable2 where (a.col2 == b.col5) group by a.col1"

When you create a database, you will find a data.json file being created in your project directory. It will store all the data that you put in your database.
