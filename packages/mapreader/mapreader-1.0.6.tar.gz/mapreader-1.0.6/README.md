## What is MapReader?

MapReader is an end-to-end computer vision (CV) pipeline for exploring and analyzing images at scale.

MapReader was developed in the [Living with Machines](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/) project to analyze large collections of historical maps but is a _**generalizable**_ computer vision pipeline which can be applied to _**any images**_ in a wide variety of domains.

## Overview

MapReader is a groundbreaking interdisciplinary tool that emerged from a specific set of geospatial historical research questions. It was inspired by methods in biomedical imaging and geographic information science, which were adapted for use by historians, for example in our [Journal of Victorian Culture](https://doi.org/10.1093/jvcult/vcab009) and [Geospatial Humanities 2022 SIGSPATIAL workshop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15592) papers. The success of the tool subsequently generated interest from plant phenotype researchers working with large image datasets, and so MapReader is an example of cross-pollination between the humanities and the sciences made possible by reproducible data science.

The MapReader pipeline consists of a linear sequence of tasks which, together, can be used to train a computer vision (CV) classifier to recognize visual features within maps and identify patches containing these features across entire map collections.

## Documentation

The MapReader documentation can be found at https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.

**New users** should refer to the [Installation instructions](https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install.html) and [Input guidance](https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Input-guidance.html) for help with the initial set up of MapReader.

**All users** should refer to our [User Guide](https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/User-guide/User-guide.html) for guidance on how to use MapReader. This contains end-to-end instructions on how to use the MapReader pipeline, plus a number of worked examples illustrating use cases such as:

- Geospatial images (i.e. maps)
- Non-geospatial images

 **Developers and contributors** may also want to refer to the [API documentation](https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html) and [Contribution guide](https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contribution-guide.html) for guidance on how to contribute to the MapReader package.

## What is included in this repo?

The MapReader package provides a set of tools to:

- **Download** images/maps and metadata stored on web-servers (e.g. tileservers which can be used to retrieve maps from OpenStreetMap (OSM), the National Library of Scotland (NLS), or elsewhere).
- **Load** images/maps and metadata stored locally.
- **Pre-process** images/maps:
  - patchify (create patches from a parent image),
  - resample (use image transformations to alter pixel-dimensions/resolution/orientation/etc.),
  - remove borders outside the neatline,
  - reproject between coordinate reference systems (CRS).
- **Annotate** images/maps (or their patches) using an interactive annotation tool.
- **Train or fine-tune** Computer Vision (CV) models and use these to **predict** labels (i.e. model inference) on large sets of images/maps.

Various **plotting and analysis** functionalities are also included (based on packages such as _matplotlib_, _cartopy_, _Google Earth_, and _[kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/))_.
