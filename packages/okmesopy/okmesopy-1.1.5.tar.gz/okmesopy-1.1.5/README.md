# OKMesoPy

NOTE: data from the Oklahoma Mesonet is copyrighted by the Oklahoma Climatological Survey and the Oklahoma Mesonet. It is the responsibility of the user of this package to ensure they follow the Mesonet Data Access Policy: https://www.mesonet.org/index.php/site/about/data_access_and_pricing

OKMesoPy is a package to aid in downloading and manipulating the Oklahoma Mesonet climate dataset. This tool was written for creating time series for use in HSPF models but it can be used by climate researchers for any data-intensive research using the Oklahoma Mesonet dataset.

**Core Dependencies:**
- NumPy
- Pandas
- GeoPy
- Missingno
- PyShp
- PyProj

**Additional Dependencies:**
- MatPlotLib is required to run the examples

**Installation:** OKMesoPy can be installed from Python Package Index (PyPI) using pip: "pip install okmesopy." Alternatively, it can be installed from source by cloning the repo and running "python setup.py install" as administrator.

**Usage:** Import the package into your code using "from okmesopy import MesonetDownloader, MesonetTools." The package is well documented in docstrings which can be read by running "help(okmesopy)" after it has been imported. The "examples.ipynb" notebook in the "examples" folder demonstrates how to use this package.

**Contributing:** We welcome all contributions. Bugs reports and feature requests can be made by opening an issue on Github. Bug fixes, new features, documentation updates, or additional Jupyter notebooks examples can be submitted by creating a pull request on Github. When contributing new code please follow these guidelines:
- Code that changes method arguments or return values must have the corresponding DOCSTRINGS updated.
- Ensure that changes do not break the Jupyter notebook(s) in the "examples" folder. Changes that affect the example notebook(s) should include corresponding updates to them.
- New methods or classes should be fully documented in DOCSTRINGS following the same format as existing code.
- New methods or classes should include example usage in a Jupyter notebook in the "examples" folder. This can be done in a new notebook or by updating an existing one.
- Changes that introduce additional dependencies should also update this README document. New core dependencies should be added to "setup.py". New dependencies that are only required for example notebooks should NOT be included in "setup.py" but should be added under "Additional Dependencies" in this document.
