# RSSReader

A robust Python-based RSS feed reader that fetches, parses, and manages updates for RSS and Atom feeds. It supports efficient conditional GET requests to minimize bandwidth and server load by utilizing `Last-Modified` and `Etag` HTTP headers.

## Features

- Parses different RSS and Atom feed formats.
- Extracts key details such as titles, links, descriptions, and associated images.
- Utilizes `Last-Modified` and `Etag` headers to perform conditional GET requests, avoiding unnecessary data transfer if the feed has not been updated since the last fetch.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `feedparser` library

## Installation

First, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. Then, you can install the required `feedparser` library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install cd-rss-reader
```

Usage
To use the RSSReader class, create an instance with the URL of the RSS feed you wish to parse:

```python

from cd_rss_reader import RSSReader

# Initialize the reader with the feed URL
url = "https://www.example.com/rss_feed_url.xml"
reader = RSSReader(url)

# Fetch and parse the feed
reader.fetch()

# Get basic information about the feed
print(f"Feed Title: {reader.get_title()}")
print(f"Feed Link: {reader.get_link()}")
print(f"Feed Description: {reader.get_feed_description()}")

# Iterate over the feed entries
for entry in reader.get_entries():
    print(f"Title: {entry.title}")
    print(f"Link: {entry.link}")
    print(f"Published Date: {entry.published}")
    print(f"Summary: {entry.summary}")
    image_link = reader.get_image_link(entry)
    if image_link:
        print(f"Image Link: {image_link}")
    else:
        print("No image available.")
Replace https://www.example.com/rss_feed_url.xml with the URL of the RSS feed you want to read.
```
