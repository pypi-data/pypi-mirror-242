Added:
 - CITATION.cff file for Zenodo integration.

## v0.2.1 (2023-09-05)

Fixed:

Added:

 - Conservative regridding method, along with a benchmark notebook.
 - A "most common value" regridding method, along with a demo notebook.

Changed:
 - The API has changed. Regridding is now done with `xr.Dataset.regrid.method()`. 
   - E.g. `xr.Dataset.regrid.linear()`


## v0.1.0 (2023-08-17)
First release of `xarray-regrid`, containing:
- the implementation of linear, nearest-neighbor and cubic regridding.
- benchmarks against CDO and xESMF for linear and nearest-neighbor.
