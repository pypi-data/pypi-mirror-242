#Feedforward Chatbot AI
Welcome to the Feedforward Chatbot AI project! This project aims to create a conversational AI using a feedforward neural network architecture.

#Overview
This repository contains the code and resources needed to build and train a chatbot using a feedforward neural network. The chatbot is designed to engage in conversation based on the input it receives from users.

#Features
Feedforward Neural Network: Utilizes a feedforward architecture for natural language processing and generation.
Training Data: Customizable training data for the chatbot's learning process.
Conversation Handling: Capable of managing multi-turn conversations.
Deployment: Options to deploy the trained model for various platforms or integration into applications.
Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

#Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code

Install Dependencies:


Prepare your training data and configure the training parameters in train.py.
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
Usage:

After training, utilize the trained model for conversations by running:
bash
Copy code
python chat.py
Project Structure
data/: Contains validation datasets.
models/: Stores trained models.
train.py: Script to train the chatbot model.
chat.py: Script to interact with the trained chatbot.
