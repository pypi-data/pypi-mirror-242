of Windmill's REST API.

```bash
pip install windmill-client
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here's a basic example of how to use `windmill_client`:

```python
import windmill_client as wmill

client = wmill.Windmill()

# Create a new job
job_id = client.start_execution(path="path/to/script")

# Check job status
status = client.get_job_status(job_id)
print(f"Job Status: {status}")

# run a script synchronously
result = client.run_script(path="path/to/script")
print(f"Script Result: {result}")
```
