Description
-----------

Implementation by A. Gambrel, A. Rahlin, C. Contaldi.

XFaster is a fast power spectrum and likelihood estimator for CMB datasets. It
has most recently been used for the SPIDER B-mode polarization results, but is
intended to be generically useful for modern CMB observatories.

An accompanying paper describing the algorithm can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01172
