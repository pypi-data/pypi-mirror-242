# 1. corevolution

There is no (r)evolution without `corevulution`. Yes, I did it again. A bad pun. 

But it's more than a Haiku. So what(?!) is it? Check the documentation.

## 1.1. Why? 

I can't depend any longer on third party libraries to do the heavy lifiting. Finding and fixing errors takes too long. 

I get it - Some innovations are great and maybe my style is puristic. 

My calculations per ms grow constantly because of better hardware. My conclusion? Build purisitic and minimalistic calculations!

 The philosophy seperates me from the rest and never let me down. 
## 1.2. What?

We all do it and we want it. You want it. I want it. Linear algebra. In C. 

## Learning 

There is a lot of stuff to learn, and I don't know a lot about shipping C Code. Bear with me for a while, your patience will be rewarded. Total freedom political zones. Just coding matters here. 

## Philosophy

There is no numpy involved. We aim for standard library - nothing else.
